Using the 12 Industry Portfolio from Ken French's website, we try to predict the return of Energy sector using the returns of other sectors. The lambda parameter is chosen with 10 fold cross validation. We compare the in-sample and out-of-sample prediction error when using simple OLS and elastic net.
